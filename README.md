QT-Physics Interactive Website

## Description

This project was developed as part of the HAI810I module at the Faculty of Science, University of Montpellier.
It is an interactive website that allows users to play a story told by QT robot. Its goal is to entertain children while teaching them about the different kind of emotions. QT robot emotion's change depending on the context of the story. This code was almost integrally generated by chatgpt. 

The project is based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and consists of three main files:

index.html: The main structure of the website.

style.css: The stylesheet for layout and design.

script.js: Manages user interactions and robot QT functionalities.

## Installation

To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Git repository into your desired directory:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/qt-physics.git

Open the index.html file in a compatible web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

## Features

Interactive interface with a QT robot having different kind of emotions while telling the story.

Progress bar of the story.

Possibility of activating a player that change pages every 10 seconds.

Choice of the emotion felt by the child after the story. The website turns to the color corresponding.

Languages available are French and English.

## Design Choices

Modular code separation between structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and logic (JavaScript).

Simple and intuitive design for easy usability.

Our website should have been static but we made the choice to make dynamic with java script so it allows the child to have an interactive experience.

## Usage

Open index.html with your browser of choice. You can usually just double click on the file.

Choose a language, then if you want to change pages manually use the arrows. Otherwise press play for the "automatic" mode.

The story is splited into short passages for a smoother readablity.

QT robot reactions are displayed in real time.

At the end of the story, the user has the choice between 5 different emotions potentially felt by the reader. From that choice, the background color of the website change to a corresponding color.

To start again the user can press the Home button.
