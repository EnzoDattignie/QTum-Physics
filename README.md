QT-Physics Interactive Website

## Description

This project was developed as part of the HAI727I module at the Faculty of Science, University of Montpellier.
It is an interactive website that allows users to play a story told by QT robot. It is aimed for children. This website was conceived almost integrally by chatgpt.

The project is based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and consists of three main files:

index.html: The main structure of the website.

style.css: The stylesheet for layout and design.

script.js: Manages user interactions and robot QT functionalities.

## Installation

To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Git repository into your desired directory:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/qt-physics.git

Open the index.html file in a compatible web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

## Features

Interactive interface with a QT robot having different kind of emotions while telling the story.

Progress bar of the story.

Possibility of activating a player that change pages every 10 seconds.

Choice of the emotion felt by the child after the story. The website turns to the color corresponding.

## Design Choices

Modular code separation between structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and logic (JavaScript).

Simple and intuitive design for easy usability.

Our website should have been static but we made the choice to make dynamic with java script so it allows the child to have an interactive experience.

## Usage

Open index.html in a browser.

Interact with the interface to send commands to the QT robot.

Observe reactions and real-time displays.
